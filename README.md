# Company Data Collector (Python)

## Overview
This project showcases a Python-based solution to collect and process company data. It retrieves a company's official website URL and headquarters address using Google Search and SerpApi. The processed data is saved in an Excel file for further analysis.

## Features
- **Automated Data Collection:** Fetches URLs and HQ addresses directly from Google and Wikipedia using SerpApi.  
- **Excel File Processing:** Reads company names from an Excel file and writes the collected data back.  
- **Error Handling:** Includes robust mechanisms to handle missing or unavailable data.  
- **Comparison Versions:**
  - `collect_company_data_with_api.py`: The recommended, faster version using SerpApi.  
  - `collect_company_data_without_api.py`: A slower version scraping directly from Google Search.
